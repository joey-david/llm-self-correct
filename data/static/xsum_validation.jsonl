At the same time, the snake's intestine expanded, its gall bladder shrank and its heart increased in volume by 25%.\nThe researchers, Henrik Lauridsen and Kasper Hansen, both from Aarhus University in Denmark, explained that the increase in the size of the snake's heart was probably associated with the energy it needed to digest its meal.\n\"It's a sit and wait predator,\" explained Mr Lauridsen. \"It fasts for months and then eats a really large meal.\n\"It can eat the equivalent of up to 50% of its own bodyweight, and in order to get the energy out of the meal, it has to restart the intestinal system very fast.\"\nThe researchers, who are both based at the university's Department of Zoophysiology and the MR Research Centre at Aarhus, say that their approach has several advantages over the \"subjective and sometimes misleading\" interpretations of dissections.\nDissection induces changes, explained Dr Hansen. \"For example, after opening the dense bone of a turtle shell, the lungs will collapse due to the change in pressure.\n\"And to use these techniques you don't have to kill the animal,\" he added. \"We can do this using live animals and revisit the results over and over again.\"\nThe images, they say, will be valuable tools in future studies of animal anatomy for both research and education.\nAs part of the project, they have produced similarly spectacular images of several other species, including frogs, alligators, turtles, swamp eels and bearded dragons.", "reference": "Scientists have used the latest imaging techniques to look inside a python that had just swallowed a rat whole.", "task": "summ"}

But it is still short of covering all of the banks' financing for next year,\" said James Nixon at Societe Generale.\nBorrowing money though the ECB's loans and using it to buy sovereign debt has been dubbed 'Sarkozy trade' after the French president encouraged banks to use the money to buy national debts when the loan offer was announced.\nHowever, some suggest the money will just be used to boost bank balance sheets, especially since the ECB lowered its collateral requirements when it announced the loans, enabling weaker banks to apply for the funds.\n\"A cash for trash mechanism allowing banks to access cheap funds and buy up more sovereign debt - or more likely just shore up their own finances,\" is how Justin Urquhart Stewart of Seven Investment Management described the scheme.\nBy Robert PestonBusiness editor, BBC News\nRead Robert's blog in full\nCarsten Brzeski at ING, said: \"The good news is that banks won't have to worry about liquidity for three years and that it has already pushed down government yields, as banks are buying them to use as collateral\".\n\"However, whether the ECB's hopes that the money will filter through to the real economy will be fulfilled remains to be seen.\"\nThe success of the offer initially had a positive impact on European stock markets, but the effect was short-lived and in afternoon trade several markets were trading lower on the day.\nThe ECB's move comes in the wake of turbulent times for the eurozone that have hit peripheral eurozone economies such as Greece, the Irish Republic and Portugal, and started to affect major economies such as Italy and Spain.\nBanks in all these countries have lent large amounts of money to their national governments, and others in the eurozone, by buying sovereign bonds which have, historically, been seen as relatively safe investments.\nInterest rates for these bonds, known as yields, have been rising during the past few months, reflecting a higher risk that a country may default. Italian yields, for example, hit a record 7% in November.\nThe banks that are left holding large amounts of eurozone sovereign debt are in turn seen as risky by money markets who force them to pay more to borrow money.\nThis situation encourages banks to lend less themselves, which trickles down to consumers and small businesses, which find it harder to get loans.\nThe ECB's three-year loans are designed to free up lending and avoid the kind of credit crunch that saw inter-bank lending dry up in 2008.\nAlthough the ECB has ruled out lending directly to countries, banks taking the three-year loans at 1% are being encouraged to invest in sovereign debt at 6% to 7%.\nThis not only provides a lucrative return for the banks, but increases demand for sovereign debt, helping countries such as Italy and Spain that need to raise money.", "reference": "Eurozone banks have rushed to take out cheap three-year loans offered by the European Central Bank, borrowing 489bn euros ($643bn; Â£375bn).", "task": "summ"}
